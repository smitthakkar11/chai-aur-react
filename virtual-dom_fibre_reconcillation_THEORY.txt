REACT FIBRE
Improves hydration process(JS on clicking button)


important things from documentation as per interview:

Other key features include the ability to pause, abort, or reuse work as new updates come in; 
the ability to assign priority to different types of updates; and new concurrency primitives.

reconciliation
The algorithm React uses to diff one tree with another to determine which parts need to be changed.

update
A change in the data used to render a React app. Usually the result of `setState`. Eventually results in a re-render.

Diffing of lists is performed using keys. Keys should be "stable, predictable, and unique."

fibre
pause work and come back to it later.
assign priority to different types of work.
reuse previously completed work.
abort work if it's no longer needed.
